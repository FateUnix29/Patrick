# Basic introduction to using patrick

Patrick is a multi-purpose discord bot designed for the ORE community.
Please first consult the README.md for detailed information on how to set up Patrick.

## Commands

Commands are the primary way to interact with Patrick. They allow you to perform various actions. Most commands use the old text based system with prefix `,`. Some commands may also use discord's built in slash-command system. These commands are denoted by an asterisk `*` before their name. Some commands may be discord's "context command" system, for which you need to right click a user or message to see this command and use it. These are denoted by an ampersand `&` before their name.

## No category

- sync: Admin only command. Forces an app commands sync with discord. Required for proper functioning of slash and context commands.
- reload: Admin only command. Reloads the bot's configuration and commands. Commands in this category are excluded due to technical reasons.
